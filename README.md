# ScummTR ‚Äì Fan translation tools for LucasArts SCUMM games

This project hosts the sources of Thomas Combeleran's fan translation tools for most LucasArts [SCUMM engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM) games, from *Maniac Mansion* to *The Dig*.

They are known as `scummtr`, `scummrp`, `scummfont`, and `FontXY`. They were originally only available as Windows programs, but they're now open-source and available for various systems.

## Download

üëâ Downloads for various systems are available [on the Releases page](https://github.com/dwatteau/scummtr/releases). It is recommended to **always use the latest version**.

Note that you need to know how to use [a command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) in order to use ScummTR, though.

## How to use

üëâ [The FAQ](FAQ.md) is here to answer the most usual questions. Please read it first if you have any problem.

Some [manual pages](man/txt/) are also available.

If you have any problem, suggestion or question, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/dwatteau/scummtr/discussions/new) or [report an issue](https://github.com/dwatteau/scummtr/issues/new/choose)!

## Compiling

If you'd like to compile ScummTR yourself, you will need [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a C++98 compatible compiler. It should build on Windows and most POSIX (macOS, Linux, and so on) systems.

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

See also [how the official releases are made](releases/README.md).

## Current goals

The current purpose of this repository is to host the original sources of the ScummTR tools, and provide a simple way of using them on most platforms.

My C++ skills are very modest, and the tools are mostly ‚Äúdone‚Äù, so for the moment no big evolution is planned, except for small bug fixes.

However, it is known that the tools currently don't support some game variants, such as Maniac Mansion NES, or Loom TurboGrafx-16. They may become compatible in a future release.

Bug reports, questions and contributions are, of course, very welcome. I suggest having a look at [NUTCracker](https://github.com/BLooperZ/nutcracker), too; it has a much more modern architecture and is more maintained than ScummTR.

## Alternatives and complementary tools

[NUTCracker](https://github.com/BLooperZ/nutcracker) is a more general set of tools, with an emphasis on later SCUMM games (*Monkey Island 1* CD and later titles, Humongous Entertainment games), while ScummTR mainly targets translations and supports earlier LucasArts SCUMM games. NUTCracker should also generally be preferred for languages not based on the Latin alphabet.

[ScummSpeaks](http://www.jestarjokin.net/apps/scummspeaks/) uses ScummTR in order ‚Äúto assist in adding or replacing speech‚Äù to the later SCUMM games. See also [ScummPacker](http://www.jestarjokin.net/apps/scummpacker/), [Scummbler](http://www.jestarjokin.net/apps/scummbler/) and [ScummImg](http://www.jestarjokin.net/apps/scummimg/) from the same author.

[Quickandeasysoftware](https://quickandeasysoftware.net/software) has also been providing extremely nice tools, for years.
