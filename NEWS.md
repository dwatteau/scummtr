## ScummTR 0.6.0 (202?-??-??)

### Bugfixes

- ScummTR: Fix a fatal "ERROR: Unknown function id 0x2E" error when trying to import/export text for the German releases of Indy3. This is because of an original issue in the official German releases of the game, where some Eszett characters were badly encoded.

### New features

- ScummTR: try to detect and warn when lines end with bogus `\013` sequences, which can cause some subtle issues with ScummVM or the original interpreters. These sequences would appear when the `-w` option was used for an initial export, but forgotten in a subsequent import.
- ScummTR: when doing an import, try to detect files with Windows CRLF end of lines, so that the `-w` option will be turned on, even if the user forgot to do so. (It's still recommended to explicitly add this option when working with such files, though.)
- ScummTR: add a new `-n` option, which prevents ScummTR from emitting any `;; ScummTR note:` comment. This may help some older derivative tools, such as ScummSpeaks or LanguageBundleBuilder, which don't expect them (since original ScummTR 0.4 never produced them).
- Various manual page and warning message improvements.

## ScummTR 0.5.1 (2022-02-27)

### Bugfixes

- ScummTR/ScummRP: Fix a fatal "Bad OIv2 offset" error with (at least) some versions of Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken and Indy3. This regression was introduced in 0.5.0.

### Known bugs

- ScummTR/ScummRP: Mark all V2 versions of Maniac Mansion as unsupported, and not just the English V2 version. The French V2 version has the same corruption problem as the English version, for example.

## ScummTR 0.5.0 (2022-02-22)

### New features

- MS-DOS binaries have been added, on top of the macOS, Linux and Windows binaries.
- macOS binaries now have support for PowerPC and Apple silicon processors.
- Manual pages have been added (with .txt versions for systems where the original format is impractical).
- ScummTR: add a new `-r` option, which interprets the text of the game "as-is", in its original encoding. This can be useful for non-Latin languages such as Japanese.
- ScummTR: make it possible to import back a translation file created with the `-h` and/or `-I` options.
- ScummTR: add some encoding headers at the start of the translation file, so that most text editors will properly detect its encoding.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: make "XX.LFL should actually end at 0x1234" a warning which is always displayed, instead of being only printed in verbose mode.
- ScummFont: when importing a font, you now don't have to manually replace the original file with the `-new` file anymore.
- ScummFont: provide more details if an unsupported BMP file is given as an input.

### Bugfixes

- ScummTR/ScummRP: Fix a game corruption bug with at least LOOM-EGA (and possibly some earlier games too), such as clicking on the hole of the leftmost tree of the forest at the start of the game. In the official pre-built binaries, only `scummtr-0.4.2-win32.zip` was impacted by this corruption issue.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: fix a fatal "Duplicate offset in index" error with some versions of LOOM-EGA-EN.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: don't fail when the DISK09.LEC file is missing for MONKEY1-EGA, since it was only available through the Roland Update.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: don't fail and report missing files for the 4-disk floppy versions of MONKEY1, because only the 8-disk floppy versions need them.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: detect and reject the default version of MONKEY1-EGA that Limited Run Games sold in its Monkey Island Anthology; its DISK04.LEC file is known to be corrupted, but we have a guide describing how to recover it.
- ScummFont: reject more incompatible BMP files, instead of trying to use them and then silently corrupting the internal SCUMM fonts. Note that this makes ScummFont very strict; at the moment, it is recommended to use GIMP (with the "Do not write color space information" export option), or older versions of Microsoft Paint if you need to edit a BMP font.

### Incompatibilities with the previous version

- ScummTR: a translation file created by an earlier version of ScummTR will not necessarily be compatible with this new version. It is recommended to make a backup, import (`-i`) your current translation with the old ScummTR, and extract (`-o`) it again with the new ScummTR.
- ScummTR: the default value for the `-f` option is now the `scummtr.txt` file, instead of `./text`.
- ScummTR: the `-h` and `-I` options are now ignored, when the `-b` option is used.
- ScummRP: the default value for the `-d` option is now the `DUMP` directory, instead of the current (`.`) directory.
- ScummTR/ScummRP: unrecognized options now produce an immediate fatal error, instead of being silently ignored.

### Known bugs

- MANIAC-V2-EN is unsupported. This is because of an existing bug in the original game: any change made to the resources would amplify it and corrupt the game. Possible workaround: work from MANIAC-V1-EN or from a non-English version of Maniac Mansion V2.
- Some versions of MONKEY1-FLOPPY-VGA are currently unsupported. Possible workaround: work from a later version of MONKEY1-FLOPPY-VGA (it should display a higher number than "1.0" when doing Ctrl-V in-game).
- ScummTR: the `-b` option may not correctly work with all games. Possible workaround: use the `-r` option.

### Portability (for developers)

- Big-endian systems are now completely supported.
- Drop support for MSVC versions lower than 2015, because of their improper support for safe constructs such as `snprintf()`.
- Fix an incorrect usage of `std::sort()`, which could (at least) occur with g++ >= 4.5 and associated libstdc++.

## ScummTR 0.4.2 (2020-11-28)

### New features

- The original sources have been modified to be compatible with most modern systems.
- New binaries for Mac Intel systems.
- 64-bit binaries for Linux are now available too.

### Bugfixes

- None.

### Portability (for developers)

- Compatibility fixes for modern compilers, and CMake configuration. C++98 is still used by default.
- Fix a possible incompatibility with some strict-alignment systems.
- Fix fatal 64-bit errors on non-Windows systems.

## ScummTR 0.4.1 (2020-11-08)

### New features

- The ScummTR tools are now open-source (using the MIT License), thanks to Thomas Combeleran, their original author.
- The original sources have been recompiled "as-is" on circa-2003 Intel 32-bit systems. That's it.

### Bugfixes

- None.

### Incompatibilities with the previous version

- None.

## ScummTR 0.4.0 (2003-10-12)

Until 2020, the ScummTR tools were only available as win32 binaries, unmodified since their original upload.

They're still available from their original server (with the associated SHA256 sums), as of 2022:
