.Sh NAME
.Nm scummfont
.Nd transform SCUMM fonts to bitmap image files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm scummfont
.Cm i
.Ar FONTFILE
.Ar image.bmp
.Nm scummfont
.Cm o
.Ar FONTFILE
.Ar image.bmp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool transforms SCUMM font files between their internal
format and a bitmap representation.
The mode of operation is chosen with one of the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm i
Import the content of an
.Pa image.bmp
bitmap file into the specified
.Ar FONTFILE
SCUMM block.
.It Cm o
Extract a font from a
.Ar FONTFILE
SCUMM block into an
.Pa image.bmp
bitmap file.
.El
.Pp
.Ar FONTFILE
can either be a
.Dq CHAR_*
block extracted by
.Xr scummrp 1 ,
or an LFL file containing a font resource (usually 98.LFL+ or 901.LFL+).
.Pp
The high-resolution fonts from the Macintosh versions of Indy 3 and Loom
are currently not supported.
.Pp
Generated bitmap files contain every character available in the selected font.
Characters are sorted in the ascending order of the font table; that is, the
19th displayed character is always accessible in a
.Xr scummtr 1
translation file by using the
.Dq \e019
decimal sequence.
.Pp
The original SCUMM games usually followed an MS-DOS code page for reference
(such as CP437 or CP850), with local modifications.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
tool was written between 2003 and 2004 by Thomas Combeleran for the ATP team,
and was open-sourced in 2020 under the MIT license.
.Sh CAVEATS
Only simple, uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMPv3 bitmap files (also known as
Windows 3.x bitmap files) preserving the original 256-color ScummFont palette
are supported.
.Pp
Note that most modern image editors will change some settings anyway, but
ScummFont doesn't accept this, so many BMP files will be rejected, at the
moment.
.Pp
However, the GIMP image editor, with its
.Dq "Do not write color space information"
BMP export setting, can be used to edit the original BMP files while
preserving their original settings.
Old versions of Microsoft Paint may also work.
