.Nm scummfont
.Cm o
.Ar FONTFILE

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool transforms SCUMM font files between their internal format and a bitmap representation.
The mode of operation is chosen with one of the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm i
Import the content of an
.Pa image.bmp
bitmap file into the specified
.Ar FONTFILE
SCUMM resource, with a
.Dq -new
suffix added to it.
.It Cm o
Extract a font from a
.Ar FONTFILE
SCUMM resource into an
.Pa image.bmp
bitmap file.
.El
.Pp
.Ar FONTFILE
can either be a
.Dq CHAR_*
block extracted by
.Xr scummrp 1 ,
or an LFL file containing a font resource.
.Pp
Generated bitmap files contain every character available in the selected font.
Characters are sorted in the ascending order of the font table; that is, the
19th displayed character is always accessible in a
.Xr scummtr 1
translation file by using the
.Dq \e019
decimal sequence.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
tool was written between 2003 and 2004 by Thomas Combeleran for the ATP team,
and was open-sourced in 2020 under an MIT license.
.Sh CAVEATS
Only simple, uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMPv3 bitmap files (also known as
Windows 3.x bitmap files) with 256 colors are supported.
.Pp
If your input file is rejected after having been modified by an external tool,
Netpbm can be used to revert it to a compatible format:
.Pp
.Dl $ bmptoppm input.bmp | ppmtobmp -windows -bpp 8 > compatible-output.bmp
