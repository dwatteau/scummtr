SCUMMFONT(1)                General Commands Manual               SCUMMFONT(1)

NAME
     scummfont - transform SCUMM fonts to bitmap image files

SYNOPSIS
     scummfont i FONTFILE image.bmp
     scummfont o FONTFILE image.bmp

DESCRIPTION
     The scummfont tool transforms SCUMM CHARv1 and CHARv3 font files between
     their internal format and a bitmap representation.  The mode of operation
     is chosen with one of the following options:

     i       Import the content of an image.bmp bitmap file into the specified
             FONTFILE SCUMM resource.

     o       Extract a font from a FONTFILE SCUMM resource into an image.bmp
             bitmap file.

     FONTFILE can either be a "CHAR_*" block extracted by scummrp(1), or an
     LFL file containing a font resource.

     Generated bitmap files contain every character available in the selected
     font.  Characters are sorted in the ascending order of the font table;
     that is, the 19th displayed character is always accessible in a
     scummtr(1) translation file by using the "\019" decimal sequence.

HISTORY
     The scummfont tool was written between 2003 and 2004 by Thomas Combeleran
     for the ATP team, and was open-sourced in 2020 under an MIT license.

CAVEATS
     Only simple, uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMPv3 bitmap files (also known
     as Windows 3.x bitmap files) preserving the original 256-color ScummFont
     palette are supported.

     Note that most modern image editors will change some settings anyway, but
     ScummFont doesn't accept this, so many BMP files will be rejected, at the
     moment.

     However, the GIMP image editor, with its "Do not write color space
     information" BMP export setting, can be used to edit the original BMP
     files while preserving their original settings.  Old versions of
     Microsoft Paint may also work.
