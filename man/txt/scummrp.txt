SCUMMRP(1)                  General Commands Manual                 SCUMMRP(1)

NAME
     scummrp - pack and unpack SCUMM game data blocks

SYNOPSIS
     scummrp -i [-qvV] [-t tag] -g gameid -p gamedir -d dumpdir
     scummrp -o [-qvV] [-t tag] -g gameid -p gamedir -d dumpdir
     scummrp -L

DESCRIPTION
     The scummrp tool imports and exports game data blocks for SCUMM engine
     games.  The mode of operation is chosen with one of the following
     options:

     -i      Import blocks into the game files.

     -o      Export blocks from the game files.

     -L      List all supported games with their respective gameid.

     The other options are as follows:

     -d dumpdir
                The path to the dump directory (default: DUMP).  Game content
                is represented as a hierarchy of multiple files and
                subdirectories.  If it doesn't exist, the directory will be
                created.

     -g gameid  The ID of the game variant to pack or unpack, as given by -L.

     -p gamedir
                The path to the game (default: current directory).

     -q         Quiet mode.  Suppress informational output.

     -t tag     Only export/import game blocks matching the specified tag.  A
                tag is the internal name of a block type inside SCUMM, such as
                "SCRP" or "CHAR".

     -v         Verbose mode.

     -V         Same as -v, but list block names as they're being treated.

EXAMPLES
     Dump all the blocks from Monkey Island 2 to the DUMP_MI2 directory:

           $ scummrp -g monkey2 -p /path/to/MI2 -od DUMP_MI2

     Dump the global scripts from the Talkie CD version of Loom, using default
     paths:

           $ scummrp -g loomcd -t SCRP -o

HISTORY
     The scummrp tool was written in 2003 by Thomas Combeleran for the ATP
     team, and was open-sourced in 2020 under the MIT license.

CAVEATS
     On case-sensitive file systems, game data files must currently follow the
     DOS convention of being all-uppercase to be properly detected.

     SCUMM v0, SCUMM v8 and Humongous games are not supported.
