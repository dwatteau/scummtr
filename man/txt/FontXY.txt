FONTXY(1)                   General Commands Manual                  FONTXY(1)

NAME
     FontXY - adjust glyph dimensions inside SCUMM fonts

SYNOPSIS
     FontXY i CHARFILE
     FontXY o CHARFILE

DESCRIPTION
     The FontXY tool lets you adjust the relative size of each glyph (or
     character) inside a SCUMM character file.  The mode of operation is
     chosen with one of the following options:

     i       Import glyph dimensions from a XY.txt file into the specified
             CHARFILE resource.

     o       Export glyph dimensions from the specified CHARFILE resource into
             a XY.txt file.

     CHARFILE must be a "CHAR_*" resource file, as extracted by scummrp(1).

     Glyph dimensions are represented as a series of `X;Y' coordinates,
     relative to zero, each glyph being separated by a new line.  Empty glyphs
     are represented as empty lines.

     team, and was open-sourced in 2020 under an MIT license.

CAVEATS
     Only newline characters native to the current platform are accepted (CRLF
     on Windows and LF on most other systems).

     XY.txt pathname is hardcoded.
